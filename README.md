# YouTube to MP3 Downloader (macOS)

This is a simple bash script that downloads the audio from a YouTube video and saves it as an MP3 file to your **Downloads** folder.

## ✅ Features

- Extracts audio from YouTube videos
- Converts to MP3 using `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`
- Saves the file as `Downloads/Video Title.mp3`

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (macOS)

### 1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Install yt-dlp and ffmpeg

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

### 3. Save the Script

Create a file called `youtube_downloader.sh` and paste the contents from the script file in this repository.

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x youtube_downloader.sh
```

## ▶️ How to Use

In Terminal, navigate to the folder where your script is saved:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/script
```

Then run the script:

```bash
./youtube_downloader.sh
```

The MP3 file will be saved to your `~/Downloads` folder with the video title as the filename.
